# Personal Finance
This is an application built on the MERN software stack to keep track of the personal finance of an individual

# What does it consist of?
It consists of mainly 2 accounts namely capital and expenses and any monetary gain has to be recorded to the capital account and any expense has to be brought down to the expenses account, I know it's baremininum but simplicity works at times!

# Features
Based on the date of transaction recorded it populates the graphs - there are 2 graphs
## * Month-wise graph
## * Year-wise graph
The graphs are handled using ChartJS and a mail is sent to the owner/person for whom the accounts are being maintained on the 1st of every month resembling the stats like total income, total expenditure, percentage change w.r.t the last month, mean percentage of the whole year and stuff

# Caveats
Surely there are drawbacks to everything and a notable drawback is the frontend which I'm sure is not properly designed as per the standards but efforts will be taken to improve the level
